Index entires are as follows: 
```name, version, version-used-to-edit-or-test```
Only `name` and `version` values are functionally important(required).
- `name` must match the name(without .arcTutorial2) of the file in `Tutorials\`.
- `version` must change for a client to update the file when cache is exhausted.

This resporitory is used to host Arcanists 2 Tutorials that can be served to the client - If you'd like to upload a tutorial join the Arcanists 2 discord and ask.
